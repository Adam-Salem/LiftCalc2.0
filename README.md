# LiftCalc2.0

LiftCalc2.0 will prompt the user for their desired exercise, and ask the most weight they've lifted at 4-6 repetitions. It will then output the projected 1 rep maximum weight for that exercise back to the user. This works as a general calculator for upper body and lower body exercises and excepts both metric and imperial units.

This is the updated version of lift-calc as that one had many issues with the repository.
